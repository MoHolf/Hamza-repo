## Premium league table for the 2018-2019 season
Data <- read_html( "https://www.premierleague.com/matchweek/3285/table")


PLTable <- html_table(html_nodes(Data, "table")[[2]])

##Changed the names of a few coulmns to make them easier to understand
names(PLTable)[4]<-paste("Goal_Difference")
names(PLTable)[5]<-paste("Points")

##Used the two columns to create a plot
plot <- ggplot (PLTable, aes (Points, Goal_Difference))

##Title String to use as title for the plot
TString <- "EPL 2018-2019 \nGoal_Difference vs Points Plot "
