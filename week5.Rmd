## A link to a table that shows all the presidents of the US with their dates of birth and death if they are dead
Data <- read_html( "https://www.presidentsusa.net/birth.html")


Presidents <- html_table(html_nodes(Data, "table")[[1]])

## I calculated their age as if they were still alive today, some are still alive.

currentDate = Sys.Date()

## I added all the birth dates to a vector
DOB <- as.vector(Presidents$'Birth Date')

## and changed them to dates
DOB <- as.Date(DOB, "%b%d,%Y")

## new vector with the same size as DOB
age <- as.numeric(DOB) 

## I used a for loop to calculate the age of each president and stored it in the new vector
for (i in seq_along(DOB)){
  
  age[i] <-age_calc(DOB[i], as.Date(currentDate), units ="years")

}

## and then I added the new vector to the table
newTable <- cbind (Presidents, "Years Since Birth" = age)
newTable
