```{r}
Data <- read_html( "https://www.premierleague.com/matchweek/3285/table")

##I used the data of the current English Soccer league
PLTable <- html_table(html_nodes(Data, "table")[[2]])


##I changed the two columns that show the position of each team and their goal difference to vectors
Positions <- as.vector(PLTable$Position)

Goal_Difference<- as.vector(PLTable$GD)

##Create the data frame
data<- data.frame(Positions , Goal_Difference)

##Create a K-means cluster with three centers
##In this league there are usualy 6 teams that are figting for the top spot and 4 to 5 teams fighting to stay in the league, because the bottom 3 teams go down a divison, other teams are just in the middle and trying to get as much points as possible without aiming for anything specific. By choosing 3 centers we can see those groups all cluster together.
KCluster <- kmeans(data, centers = 3)

par (mar = rep(0.2, 4))

##Plot the K-means cluster
plot (Positions, Goal_Difference, col = KCluster$cluster, pch = 19, cex = 2)
points(KCluster$centers, col = 1:3, pch = 3, cex = 3, lwd = 3)

```
